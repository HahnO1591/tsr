            Hi, my name is Hannah Faye Ordonio. You can call me "Hannah" for short. I live in Caloocan City. In my free time, I enjoy watching true crime documentaries and reading detective stories. I find the field of criminal justice fascinating because it provides insight into the human psyche and the motivations behind criminal behavior. I love to analyze logically and think about who's the murderer. I am particularly interested in cases where investigators use forensic evidence and scientific methods to solve crimes. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I come from a family of eight, consisting of my mother, who is a homemaker, my father, who works part-time as an Electronics Technician, and five siblings - three girls and three boys. My oldest brother has strong autism and requires special care. My younger sister, the third child, is also searching for job opportunities. Additionally, my three youngest siblings are currently pursuing their studies.
          </p>
          <p>I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, majoring in Computer Science, from Quezon City Polytechnic University in April 2013. As part of my curriculum, I completed an on-the-job training program at Technology Center, located in Guadalupe, Makati City. During my internship, I was responsible for encoding and designing web pages using HTML and CSS.</p>

          <p>I held a position as an Office Clerk at BDO Insurance, where my primary responsibilities involved answering incoming calls and dispatching dental cards to all regular employees of BDO. This involved coordinating with LBC or 2Go Express for the delivery of these cards, as well as verifying that the name and shipping office address of each employee was correct. Additionally, I maintained organized records of both hard and soft copies, utilizing Microsoft Excel. I made the decision to leave this position due to its contractual or project-based nature."</p>

          <p>I have also gained professional experience as a Customer Service Representative at C3/Customer Contact Channels situated in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. As a call center agent, I handled high-volume incoming calls and was responsible for booking new reservations, resolving customer issues, answering inquiries, and responding to customers' requests. Through this experience, I learned valuable skills such as stress and pressure management, as well as interacting with a diverse group of individuals. My hard work and dedication allowed me to earn a promotion after 8 months to the IROP team, where I was responsible for booking reservations with other airlines in the event of flight cancellations due to mechanical issues.</p>

          <p>I have also gained experience as a Graphic Designer where I was responsible for creating a diverse range of visual designs for various products including tarpaulin, bags, cosmetic pouches, backpacks, lunch bags, pillows, neck pillows, and others. In this role, I utilized various software tools including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign to design book covers. Although I enjoyed my time as a Graphic Designer, however, I discovered that I have a greater interest in working in the BPO industry, which is why I decided to return to this field.</p>

          <p>I also worked at Afni as a Customer Sales Representative for 4 months. The reason why I left the job was due to a Ransomware attack that occurred at the company. As a result of the attack, our tools were changed, and we were provided with new metrics that were significantly higher than before. The new tools were difficult to use, and the higher metrics were challenging to maintain, even with the additional training and support provided.</p>

          <p>While I valued my experience as a Customer Service Representative at the call center, the challenges created by the Ransomware attack made it difficult for me to continue to be effective in my role. I realized that the changes to the tools and metrics were outside of my control and decided to seek new opportunities where I could leverage my skills and abilities in a more supportive and effective environment.</p>

          <p>I also worked as Customer Service Representative at Ibex for 4 months. I left my last job because of personal circumstances. My grandmother, who was living alone, passed away due to cancer. She left us her home in her will, and we decided to move in to take care of the property and honor her memory.</p>

          <p>In addition, I also took some time off to visit my aunt in Bulacan, who is also battling cancer. Spending time with my aunt and helping her through her treatment was a top priority for me during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>During my time away from work, I took the opportunity to focus on my professional development by enrolling in an online boot camp for web development. I have always been interested in the field of technology and wanted to explore new opportunities to expand my skill set and advance my career.</p>

          <p>In my previous role, I learned a lot and gained valuable experience, but I am now looking to transition into the IT industry. While I appreciate the skills I developed in my previous role, I am eager to explore new opportunities and challenges within the IT field.</p>

          <p>At the same time, I am also interested in working in the BPO industry. I believe that the BPO industry is one of the best industries to work in because it offers a dynamic and challenging work environment, with opportunities to build strong customer service skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. In addition, the BPO industry is known for offering competitive salaries and benefits, as well as opportunities for professional growth and advancement.</p>

          <p>I am excited about the possibility of combining my interest in the IT industry with the dynamic and challenging work environment of the BPO industry. I believe that the skills I have developed in my previous role, including strong communication, problem-solving, and customer service abilities, will be valuable in any role in the BPO industry. At the same time, I am eager to continue learning and growing as I pursue a career in IT, and I am confident that the BPO industry will offer me many opportunities to do so.</p>

          <p>I'm the kind of person who always wants to learn new things every day so that is why I am excited to be part of this company I can contribute by using the skills I acquired from my experience and I am going to learn more things from you guys.</p>

          I left my last job as an HR Officer because I had to take some time off to recover from Bell's Palsy.  Even though I wanted to continue working, it was difficult to perform my job responsibilities given my condition.  While it was a difficult experience, after consulting with my doctor, I made the difficult decision to resign from my position to fully recover. Taking a break from work helped me focus on my recovery which is why I went jump back into my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, my former boss didn't want me to resign and suggested that I take an extended leave of absence instead. Despite their suggestion, I felt it was best to step down from my role and focus on my health.

            When considering a job, salary is certainly an important factor for me. However, it's not the only factor I consider. Other important factors include work-life balance, growth opportunities, company culture, and job satisfaction. While salary is important to meet my financial needs, it's equally important for me to feel fulfilled and challenged in my role. So, while a competitive salary is important, it's not the only factor that determines my decision to accept a job offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compensation is also important to me. It reflects the value I deliver to the company and my customers. I'm less focused on that though. It'll always follow as long as I keep my skill set sharp and in demand which, to me, is the most important thing.

An inbound call center receives incoming calls from customers and outbound are the call center agents who made calls for sales, follow-ups, renewal reminders, or updates.

Happy customers are more likely to become repeat customers, refer others to the business, and leave positive reviews or feedback. Conversely, dissatisfied customers may leave negative reviews, switch to a competitor, and damage the business's reputation. Customer satisfaction is an indicator of how well a business is meeting the needs and expectations of its customers, and it's crucial for building a strong and loyal customer base. Satisfied customers can also lead to increased revenue and profitability for the business over time.</p>

        <header>What worries you the most about working in a call center?</header>
        <article>
          <p>What I am worried about the most in working in a call center is that being an introvert can be challenging at times. Some of my co-workers misinterpreted me for being shy and they think that I'm not interested in talking to people. As introverts, we tend to be quiet and reserved. After attending a party or spending time with a large group of people, introverts often feel a need to "recharged" by spending time alone.</p>
          <p>One thing that worries me about working in a call center is the potential for burnout. I know that the job can be demanding and fast-paced, and I'm concerned about being able to maintain a high level of performance over the long term. That being said, I'm committed to taking care of myself both physically and mentally, and I believe that with the right strategies and support, I can be successful in this role.</p>
          <p>I think that one of the challenges of working in a call center is dealing with difficult or angry customers. While I'm confident in my ability to de-escalate situations and provide excellent customer service, I'm also aware that there may be times when it's challenging to stay calm and professional. That being said, I'm committed to ongoing training and development to improve my skills in this area, and I'm not easily rattled by challenging situations.</p>
          <p>To be honest, one thing that worries me about working in a call center is the potential for monotony or boredom. I know that the job can involve a lot of repetitive tasks or dealing with similar issues day after day. However, I'm someone who is able to stay engaged and focused even in less stimulating situations, and I'm confident that I can find ways to keep the job interesting and fulfilling for myself. Additionally, I know that there are often opportunities for growth and advancement within call center roles, and I'm excited about the potential to take on more challenging or varied responsibilities over time.</p>

Being an introvert is a gift that doesn't need to be cured or fixed. I have extroverted friends I can say that I am a social introvert because I'm talkative. I sometimes spend my time with my extroverted friends but after a few hours, I need to recharge myself by staying quiet. I told my extroverted friends that I need a bit of time to stay quiet first. "I'm introverting." As an introvert, I'd rather spend my weekend practicing my skills to be a better person and I don't get bored very easily so I'm pretty good at entertaining myself. They said that 90% of successful and influential people are introverts. J.K Rowling, Bills Gates, Christina Aguilera, Emma Watson, Albert Einstein, Mark Zuckerberg, Barack Obama, and many more.</p>
          <p>I understand that working in a call center can have its challenges, but I believe that being prepared and having the right mindset can help me overcome them. One plan that I have to overcome any potential challenges is to stay organized and manage my time effectively, so that I am always on top of my tasks and responsibilities. I also plan to continually develop my skills and knowledge in customer service, by attending training sessions, seeking feedback from my team leader, and learning from my more experienced colleagues. Additionally, I believe that maintaining a positive attitude and good communication with both customers and colleagues can also help me overcome any challenges that I may face. Overall, I am confident in my ability to handle any challenges that may arise, and I am committed to making the most of my experience in the call center</p>

        <article>
          <p>Handling work pressure can be challenging, but I have developed several strategies to cope with it effectively.

          <p>During my college years, I experienced a lot of doubt in my ability to learn and master programming languages. I thought I wouldn't be able to finish my Information Technology degree because of the difficulty of the programming subjects.

          <p>One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn fast on the job and teach myself different skill sets. I believe my ability to learn will help me overcome that obstacle quickly which is why I am not afraid to learn new and difficult things. I have an extremely strong work ethic. When I am working on a project. I don't want to just meet deadlines. I prefer to complete the project well ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>I believe one of my greatest strengths is my ability to work even under pressure. Having worked in customer service, I fully know that this job could be stressful at times and that won't only be dealing with smiling, happy customers but also with irate and frustrated ones. In my 1 and a half years of experience, I've probably dealt with all types of customers. I'm also an attentive listener. And by attentive listening, I mean listen not only to the words that the customers are saying but also to the words that they are not saying. The non-verbal cues, the tone of voice, the pauses. They are equally important when it comes to dealing with customers efficiently. And I'm fully equipped to handle that.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="weakness">
        <header>What are your weaknesses?</header>
        <article>
          <p>I am terrible at making small talk. I used to convince myself that this is not a weakness. Because I'm an introvert, this is just how I am wired. But then I realize small talks are necessary. You see, you can't ask a stranger about his regrets in life. That'd be weird! You first need to test the waters and make bite-sized interactions. You can only do that with small talk. And I thought to myself, well this is something I should improve on. So every day, I made a conscious effort to smile at strangers, and talk to them during parties and I think I'm making progress. Face-to-face conversations with new people don't rattle me anymore. I'm still not the greatest at it but I've improved. I even enjoy it at times.</p>
          <p>One of my weaknesses is that I tend to be too much of a perfectionist at times. While it can be a good trait to have in terms of attention to detail and high standards, it can also be a weakness if it leads to spending too much time on small details and missing the bigger picture or failing to meet deadlines. This could sometimes result in overthinking and exhaustion. To address this, I have learned to prioritize my work and set realistic goals and timelines, and to seek feedback and input from others to ensure that I am on track and not getting bogged down by details.</p>
          <p>Another weakness I am working on is my public speaking skills. While I am confident in communicating one-on-one or in small groups, I sometimes struggle with speaking in front of larger audiences. To improve in this area, I have taken public speaking classes and joined a local Toastmasters club, where I can practice my skills in a supportive environment and receive constructive feedback from others.</p>

          <p>In my experience, I have found that a combination of both skills is essential for success. By anticipating potential problems, you can take steps to prevent them from happening or minimize their impact. However, even with the best planning, unexpected issues can still arise. In those situations, being able to react quickly and find creative solutions is critical to resolving the problem and ensuring customer satisfaction.</p>

        <article>
          <p>It was during my college days when a close friend of mine asked for my help in completing a web development project. The project required knowledge of HTML and CSS, and it had to be completed within three days. I was excited to help my friend and thought it would be a great opportunity for me to improve my coding skills as well.</p>
          <p>However, as the days went by, I realized that I had underestimated the amount of work involved. I was also busy with other projects for our subjects, which made it difficult for me to allocate enough time to work on my friend's project. Despite my best efforts, I was not able to complete the project within the given timeframe.</p>
          <p>Looking back, I realize that I aimed too high and did not consider the amount of work required to complete the project. However, I did not give up and continued to work on the project even after the deadline had passed. I learned that it's important to set realistic goals and deadlines and to communicate any challenges or limitations with the team or stakeholders involved. It's better to under-promise and over-deliver rather than the other way around.

          <p>In hindsight, I realize that I aimed too low by not participating in the art contest. I could have managed my time better and found a way to balance both activities.

          <p>I would work with the team member to find a solution to the problem. This may involve creating an improvement plan, identifying areas where additional training or resources may be needed, or finding ways to better support the team member.</p>
          <p>After the plan is in place, it's important to follow up regularly to ensure that progress is being made and that any issues are being addressed.</p>
          <p>If the situation does not improve, or if the team member is not willing to work towards a solution, it may be necessary to involve management to address the issue.</p>
          <p>Overall, my approach to dealing with a problematic team member would be to remain calm, communicate openly and honestly, and work collaboratively toward finding a solution.</p>

        <header>If you are given work from your manager that is boring and tedious, what will you do?</header>
        <article>
          <p>I understand that every job comes with its own set of tasks, some of which may be more tedious or repetitive than others. If I am given a task that I find boring or tedious, I will first try to understand the reason why it needs to be done and how it contributes to the bigger picture. I will also try to find ways to make the task more interesting and engaging for myself. For example, I might try to set a challenge for myself to complete the task in a shorter time or with more accuracy than I did the last time. I might also try to find ways to incorporate some creativity or problem-solving into the task to make it more enjoyable. Ultimately, I will remain focused on the end goal and remind myself that even the smallest tasks can contribute to the success of the team and the organization as a whole.</p>

        <header>What do you do when you feel burned out?</header>
        <article>
          <p>When I feel burned out, I find it helpful to take a step back and assess what's causing the burnout. I try to identify the specific tasks or responsibilities that are contributing to my stress levels, and then I look for ways to address those issues. For example, if I'm feeling overwhelmed by a particular project, I might break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, or I might ask for help from a colleague or manager. I also prioritize self-care, such as making sure I'm getting enough sleep, exercise, and downtime to recharge. Finally, I try to stay positive and maintain a growth mindset, reminding myself that challenges and setbacks are opportunities for learning and growth.</p>

        <header>Do you want to work for a small or large company and why?</header>
        <article>
          <p>When it comes to the size of the company I work for, I believe both small and large companies have their advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, the most important factor is the company culture and values, which can exist in companies of any size.</p>
          <p>However, if I had to choose between the two, I would say I am open to working for both, as each can offer unique opportunities and challenges. In a small company, there is often more room for individual contribution and innovation, and employees can gain exposure to different aspects of the business. On the other hand, a larger company may offer more resources, career advancement opportunities, and structured training programs.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I am more concerned with finding a company where I can contribute my skills and grow as a professional, regardless of its size.</p>

          <p>Working on weekends wouldn't be a problem for me. I understand that in some industries, working on weekends is a requirement to meet deadlines and ensure the success of the company. Additionally, I am committed to delivering quality work and meeting project timelines, so I am willing to put in extra hours and work on weekends if needed. That being said, I also value work-life balance and understand the importance of taking time for personal pursuits and family time. So while I am open to working weekends as needed, I also believe in clear communication and planning to ensure a healthy work-life balance for everyone involved.</p>
